"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

  def initialize(citations)

    return 0 if @citations.empty? || @citations.nil?
    length = @citations.length
    dynamic_length = 0
    rate = length - 1
    sorted_citations = @citations.uniq.sort

    while dynamic_length < rate
      index = dynamic_length + ( (rate - dynamic_length) / 2 )
      sorted_citations[index] >= (length - index) ? rate = index : dynamic_length = index + 1
